# MangaDB

- I created this with a mindset of being able to read & edit mangas -
// I wanted to make this more advanced then i could with my possible skill set and with that in mind i did impress myself a bit //

  users should to be able to add mangas to an extent and edit the certian variables i have set.
  user should also be able to create an account & login. a message will appear 'welcome "current.username" '
  
  
  my first problems started appearing with nodemon, i could see everything on my page but nodemon would error out and styles would not attach to the page 
  after a couple headache hours i seemed to fix it and i was able to keep going as planned.
